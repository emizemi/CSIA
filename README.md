# Self-Improver
Self-Improver solves a problem that many people face in their lives: not managing their time efficiently. Hence, the main goal of self-improver is to help people manage their time better and to help them achieve certain goals that theyâ€™ve set for themselves.

The main features of Self-Improver are the ability for users to set different goals they have for themselves, a way for users to write self-reflections on how they've been progressing on their goals, and a settings page that lets the user customise how the app looks like.

Self-Improver was built with Xcode.
